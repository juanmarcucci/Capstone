# Problem Statement
When looking to book short-term rental stays, such as through Airbnb, how do you know if you're getting a good deal? The area of interest might be totally unfamiliar and without context a good judgment call on affordability of the rental is uncertain. On top of this there are also seasonal patterns, changing travel preferences, and inflation which can all vary the price for the same location year after year. In order to help the consumer I am developing a website widget that can learn from historical and recent prices, analyze listings of interest, and return how over or under market price they are charging per night. This will ensure you have an edge when finding your next travel destination lodge and you feel comfortable that you can find the best deals!

# Data Acquisition
http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
Inside Airbnb is a volunteer organization/website that collects publibly available data from Airbnnb, across 100s of cities, and performs their own cleaning to make it easily accesible. For this proof-of concept model and initial exploration of the data I downloaded their 07 March, 2023, 06 December, 2022, 09 September, 2022, and 06 June, 2022 data for Los Angeles. I am using their Detailed Listings data and neighbourhoods list. A data dictionary can be found in their website and I have also dowloaded it here, in the 'data' folder.
